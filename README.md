# Payroll-Transaction-Classifier
In this project, 

I wrote the SQL to extract the useful data for model building.

I uilt a binary classifier for detecting payrolls from all bank transactions of each user at Earnin (ActiveHours. Inc).

I applied Under-sampling, over-sampling methods to handle the highly imbalanced data.

I built the logistic classifier, completed the evaluation, and built the API for back-end team.
